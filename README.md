# FileManager
A simple project to make file manipulation a bit easier, if you want to use it do it, i would really appreciate if if you use it you give a credit for the effort
however is my first upload and im not very onto this.

To use, use FileManager.construct(file) and thats all, there is documentation about all the methods in the jar file, I wont update it frecuently but if there is
something important to change or anything to add.
